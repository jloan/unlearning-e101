# English 101 -- Unlearning the Essay
## Fall 2023, Pierce College (WA)

We expect to write essays in English 101. For many of us, English 101 and the other classes we take both in high school and in college are the only p;aces were will write essays, or as we also have come to call them -- papers. Writing essays in school has become a *standardized* right of passage. 

This version of English 101 prompts you to reimagine the essay. To identify the things we've been taught -- the formaulas and standards -- about essays and to experiment with alternatives and new possibilities. These alternatives possibilities will hopefully bring feelings of pride, ownership, and creativity to you as writers. 

## Why Unlearn the Essay? 

To answer this I'll echo Carmen Kynard ("A Third University is Possible") and Paul O'Donnel ("The Unessay").
