# English 101 -- Unlearning the Essay
## Fall 2023, Pierce College (WA)

We expect to write essays in English 101. For many of us, English 101 and other classes are the only places were we will write essays, or as we also have come to call them -- papers. Writing essays in school has become a *standardized* right of passage. 

This version of English 101 prompts you to unlearn the essay in order imagine it anew. To identify and interrogate the things we've been taught about essays and to experiment with alternatives and new possibilities. My hope is that these new possibilities will bring you feelings of pride, ownership, and creativity as writers. 

## Why Unlearn the Essay? 

To answer this I'll echo Carmen Kynard (["Put Some Stank On It"](http://www.blackfeministpedagogies.com/put-some-stank-on-it-teaching-politics--policies.html)) and Daniel Paul O'Donnel (["The Unessay"](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay)). 

Essays are wonderful tools for engaging with people, ideas, and things. They are a highly flexible and open form for exploring your passions and interests in a personal style. Why unlearn them?

Unfortunately, essays have been taught in schools as a formulaic, rule-bound form of communication (use only Standard Academic English, use five-paragraphs, only write on 8.5" x 11" paper, never use "I," use MLA or APA format, don't include or use images or other media, etc.). You might pause here for a second and reflect on what you've been taught about writing essays over the years. For many people, me included, the kinds of essays we are taught to write in school only really seem useful in the quest to not lose points toward our grade. 

But essays -- both historically and now -- can be used for a whole variety of purposes and take a variety of forms. Go ahead an do a websearch for things like "essay film" or "audio essay" to get a sense of this. For some history see [Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essays_(Montaigne)) and for some now see [Kaiya Gordon](https://trianglehouse.squarespace.com/review/issue-twenty/intake-essay). 

One of the primary ways you'll hopefully be asked to put the essay to use in college is to work with the ideas of others as a process of articulating your own ideas on the things that matter to you. To do this, however, doesn't mean that your writing, whether it's an essay or any other form, should not be an embodiment of who you are in all of your identity's complex multiplicity. 

[Insert Kynard's "Academic writing is..."]

There's also an antiracist goal in an attempt to *unlearn the essay*. Again, to *unlearn* something is to examine the assumptions we have about a thing and rethink them in order to experiment with alternatives. To *unlearn the essay* then is to identify and interrogate the power structures and dynamics that shape how our understandings of the essay -- and writing more broadly -- have come to be constraiuned by such narrow standards and, often, used as a tool of reinforcing the values of white supremacy and colonialism. We'll dscuss and consider these things all while we also experiment with what else might be possible.

Finally, we have also entered a period in which our machines can easily replicate the most generic and narrrow visions of what the essay, and again writing more generally, can be. Tools like ChatGPT prompt us to ask questions like -- what's human about writing? If our machines can do much of the basics -- use Standard Academic English, format our work, provide surface-level dicussions of a topic, etc. -- much of what traditional essay assignments prompt us to do and obsess over...Then what's in it for us? Why might writing still matter? 

Admittedly, I don't really have an answer for these questions. My speculation is that possibilities reside in making something that's your own, something that brings you pride, and something that brings a sense of being creative. My hope is that we can begin to answer theses kinds of questions both collectively and for oursleves. 


## What We'll Work On

This quarter will work on two projects.

In the first phase of class, roughly weeks 1 - 5, *we will craft an essay and then encode it ourselves into a simple website*. We'll use some basic HTML and CSS. You will then be able to either run your website/essay exclusively on a single computer, or decide to share it more broadly on the web. In doing this we'll *unlearn* -- amongst other things -- that word processing software like Microsoft Word is the sole medium of essays/writing. If the prospect of using HTML and CSS scares you, that's OK! No prior experience is necessary. All you need is an openess to experimentation. You will surprise yourself. You can do this. I promise. 

The second phase of class, roughly weeks 6 - 11, *you will work on an Unessay project*. The "Un" in Unessay means that your project is free to be something beyond the traditional confines of a "school essay." Your Unessay might be a continuation/reimagining of the website/essay you developed in the first part of the class. It might be something entirely different. Your experiments with the essay form are welcome.You will be able to choose your own focus/topic for for your Unessay and your Unessay can be in any form/medium you chose. For example, it could take the form of a physical document or artifact or a video or a work of audio/sound or a story map. Most importantly -- it should be composed from within the linguistic and cultural practices that matter to you. 

Finally, you will have the choice to publish your Unessay project or your website/essay in a class collection I've tentatively titled "On..." and that will be made availible via [a Pressbook published through OPENWA](https://openwa.pressbooks.pub/unessays/). Ideally, those of us who opt in to this publication will come up with a title for collectively. 


## What We'll Read


We'll read a variety of things. 

Somethings will be about writing, language and essays like:
+ Paul Lynch's ["The Sixth Paragraph: A Re-Vision of the Essay"](https://writingspaces.org/past-volumes/the-sixth-paragraph-a-re-vision-of-the-essay/) 
+ Excerpts from Geneva Smitherman's [*Talkin' and Testifyin': The Language of Black America*](https://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/talkin-and-testifyin)
+ Excerpts from David Mura's [*A Stranger's Journey: Race, Identity, and Narrative Craft in Writing*](https://ugapress.org/book/9780820353463/a-strangers-journey/)
+ Mark Sample's ["What's Wrong With Writing Essays?"](https://samplereality.com/2009/03/12/whats-wrong-with-writing-essays/).

Somethings will be what I hope are generative examples of what's possible. Things like: 
+ Joy Priest's ["I Feel the Most Southern in the Hip-Hop of Adolescence"](https://bittersoutherner.com/features/2020/i-feel-most-southern-in-the-hiphop-of-my-adolescence)
+ Emma Winston's ["Unconditional Positive Regard"](https://deerful.itch.io/unconditional-positive-regard)
+ Jackie Liu's ["Making a Website: By You and For You"](https://jackieis.online/projects/making-a-website-by-you-and-for-you-zine/)

Somethings will be things we listen to and watch like:
 + Kiese Laymon's ["On Radical Revision"](https://www.thisisthresholds.com/episodes/kiese-laymon-on-radical-revision) 
 + Justin Graffa's ["The Art of Trespassing"](https://jumpplus.net/issues/volume-1/issue-8-1/the-art-of-trespassing-8-1/)


You'll also have a chance to engage in some project research that hopefully will help you identify texts and writers that matter to you. 


## Schedule

### Week/Module 1

Let's get started! 

This week we'll intorduce ourselves and discuss the course and the work we'll be doing. One of the routines I have is to give everybody a notecard and have you write your preferred name and pronouns on one side. I'll then collect these as you exit (and do this for the first hadnful of class sessons) and this helps me connect names with people. On the flip side of the card I'll ask you to jot down any questions you have about the course as well as your answer to this -- *If you could write about anything this quarter what would it be?* I really mean anything. Too often students think there are "school topics" that have to be different than the things we actually care about. One of the best answers I've gotten to this question recently is -- "Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles." Let's f-ing go. That's what I'm talking about!

This week we'll also set-up some writing infrastructure for the course. *Writing is a technology, and already always mediated.* (We'll talk about this.) One of the ways we'll *unlearn* the essay this quarter is that we'll use a text editor to do much of our writing. A text editor is not a word processor like MSWORD or Google Docs. It does not present you with tools for formating your work and it isn't structured by the framework of a page. Students often stress about things the number of words or pages they have to write in writing assignments. (How long does it have to be?) What happens when we write a space that doesn't focus our attention on these things or on pre-determined formats? What possibilities open when our focus is not about word or page counts or format but language, the words themselves? Most computers come with a text editor pre-installed. Windows comes with [Notepad](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-notepad/9MSMLRH6LZF3) and Mac comes with [TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/welcome/mac). There are a bunch of text editors out there you can download -- I currently use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and have used [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html). Honestly, though, for our purposes you shouldn't need an editor beyond what is already included in your operating system. 

Okay...before we start Week 2, do this:

+ Have located and accessed the text editor you'll use this quarter.  
+ Read Paul Lynch's ["The Sixth Paragraph: A Re-Vision of the Essay"](https://writingspaces.org/past-volumes/the-sixth-paragraph-a-re-vision-of-the-essay/) and Joy Priest's ["I Feel the Most Southern in the Hip-Hop of Adolescence"](https://bittersoutherner.com/features/2020/i-feel-most-southern-in-the-hiphop-of-my-adolescence). 


### Week/Module 2

This week we'll work on a couple of things. 

*First*, we'll use Paul Lynch's and Joy Priest's writing to start thinking about *essays*. How might we define them? What's the essay's history? What qualities do they tend to exhibit? What shapes do they take? What have our experiences been with them? This conversaation will hopefully begin to inform the things we might experiment with in our own writing. This convesation will also invite us, I think, to start talking about a little about the comcept of genre. 

By the end of Week 2/start of Week 3 do this:

+ Read [an essay from Hanif Abduraqquib](https://trianglehouse.squarespace.com/review/issue-four/on-seatbelts-and-sunsets) and Ander Monson's [essay about essays](http://otherelectricities.com/swarm/essayashack.html).

And this: 

+ Draft an essay. 
+ Your essay can be "On..." any topic you want. Remember Montaigiane ("On Idelness..."; etc.) and Abdurarquib ("On Seatbelts and Sunsets")  Your topic might relate to the thing you most want to write about from your notecard, but it doesn't have to. 
+ It can be as long as you need it to be. No page or word count.
+ Don't do any additional research
+ No format. Just plain text. The only real firm rule -- your essay  must be written using a text editor (See Week 1). This means you'll end up with a plain text file with the extension .txt.
+ Give your essay a title.
+ Write a short reflection (what will become an artist's statement) for your draft. Also plain text. (See below what to address in your reflection.)

In your short reflection, do this:

+ Summarize your project in 1 - 2 sentences. (Note -- I'll be calling your essay, even it's early stages, a "project.")

+ What surprised you while you where crafting your initial project draft?

+ What aspect(s) of the initial project draft posed the greatest challenge for you?

+ What successes might you point to at this point in the project?

+ What is your vision for a future draft?  

+ What do you need help sorting out? Pose three questions about your project to guide conversation and feedback. 

Need/Want some topic ideas? Try one of these:

+ On [insert song title or film title or TV Show tite here]. *See Hanif's (On Seatbelts and Sunsets)
+ On [insert what makes you feel the most __________ ] *See Preist's "I Feel the Most Southern..."*
+ On [insert any evocative concept here] *Ex: Distance or closeness or being connected or being disconnected....*

 

### Week/Module 3

This week the focus of our work will be threefold:

+ We'll discuss our initial project drafts. This will not be what you might have previously experienced as "peer review." Our goal is not to fix anyone's work. Our goal is to have some informal convesation about our experiences as writer's working on a project. 
+ We'll also be creating initial versions of our own individual *Guides to Unlearning the Essay*. We'll use the readings we've done so far from Lynch, Preist, Monson, and Abduraquib to make these. This guide is meant to be *advice to yourself from yourself on how to not fall into old habits or assumptions about writing and to instead explore new ideas and possibilities.* 
+ We'll be revising/developing our essay drafts by atttempting to work with the ideas of other writers in relation to our own. 

Do this to draft your personal *Guide to Unlearing the Essay*:

+ Read Rigoberto Lara Guzmán's ["How To Cite Like a Badass Feminist Tech Scholar of Color"](https://points.datasociety.net/how-to-cite-like-a-badass-tech-feminist-scholar-of-color-ebc839a3619c) and Jerry Saltz's ["How to Be an Artist"](https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/jerry-saltz-how-to-be-an-artist.html) for inspirartion and a sense of how "guides" work. Note: Saltz's guide is behind a paywall -- you might be able to check it out once or twice, but then the pay wall kicks in. Here's where Pierce's Library databases come in handy. If you run into the paywall, you might practice using the Library databases to access that text. Don't have any clue about finding info in the Library databases. Let's talk about it!
+ Spend some time reflecting on your own understanding of the essay and writing -- what you've been taught, the sorts of habits or approaches you typically use, your beliefs and assumptions about writing, etc. 
+ Revisit the readigs we did in the last 2 weeks (the Lynch and Priest and Monson and Abdurraquib). Consider the ways that these writer's have understood the essay, particularrly those moments when they contrast or resist they ways we've been taught to thinnk about and write essays. The Lynch and Monson explicitly address *new* ways to think about and practice essay writing, but the Priest and Abdurraquib also offer visions of what essays can do and be that you might find contrast with the rules and expectations you've previsously been taught. 
+ Assemble/write your guide in plain text. Have at least 5 - 8 elements on it that you could practice in order to *unlearn the essay*. Attempt to cite Lynch, Monson, Priest and Abdurraquib in your guide.  
+ Remember -- like your essay draft; your guide should be written in a text editor (plain text).

Do this to revise/develop your initial essy draft:

+ Create a copy of your initial essay draft and name the file "revised-essay.txt" or something like that. 
+ Locate a text (perhaos another essay) by a writer who is writing about the same ideas you are. 
+ Use the ideas of this writer into your draft. You might do this via direct quotation or paraphrase. We'll workshop in class some appraches for using and citing the work of ther writers ontop our own. You may already be savvy with this. May not. Either way, give it try. 
+ Having used the work of another writer, add a "Works Cited" section to your draft.
+ Don't worry about a specific format (i.e. MLA, APA, etc.), just try to make clear that you are using the ideas/work of another writer in relation to your own. If you feel familiar with a format like MLA or APA, feel free to use that as a guide.

Update your earlier reflection:

+ Again, make a copy of the original file. Name it someting like "updated-reflection.txt." 
+ Add a paragraph or so about the other writer's text you chose to use in relation to your own ideas. Why this text? What questions -- try to pose a couple -- do you have about working with the words and ideas of other writers?
